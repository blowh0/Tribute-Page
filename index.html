         <p>Billie Eilish first burst onto the UK music scene at just 14-years-old with the track 'Ocean Eyes'. Destined for stardom, she grew up in Los Angeles, California and no stranger to breaking boundaries, Billie's road to success began with her firmly at the wheel - steering away from the norm, and instead paving her own way.

Since she arrived onto the music scene, Billie has become known for having a flair for doing things a bit differently. From her trademark green hair, to killer lyrics and videos, it's no surprise that the singer was able to gain a loyal fanbase, and began her astonishing career at age 14, going on to achieve huge success including two 2024 Grammy wins, and a Golden Globe nomination for her song 'What Was I Made For?'. Now the singer has been teasing new music and released her third album, called 'Hit Me Hard and Soft'. This will be followed by a tour starting in September 2024, and coming to the UK in July 2025.
